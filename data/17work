Register A: 64584136
Register B: 0
Register C: 0

Program:
2,4 //bst 4 does A % 8 -> B
1,2 //bxl 2 B ^ 2 -> B
7,5 //cdv 5 (int) A / (2 ** B) -> C
1,3 //bxl 3 B ^ 0b11 -> B
4,3 //bxc 3 B ^ C -> B
5,5 //out 5 outputs contents of register B
0,3 //adv 3 extracts lowest 3 bits of A -> A, after last output has to be divisble by 8, can't be divisible by 8 before that
3,0 //jnz 0, goes back to beginning unless A == 0, halts on A == 0
